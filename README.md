# Homepage v7

This is version 7 of my homepage, now much simpler and without JS :P

The goal was to make it as light as possible, without any JavaScript, using system defaults and CSS variables for automatic light/dark mode support. I also wanted it to scale perfectly no matter what device or screen you're on.

It's just a virtual business card but by all means fork/use the theme, just share in kind and refer back.
